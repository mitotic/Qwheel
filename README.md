# Qwheel

## Description

Question Wheel (Qwheel) is a front-end implementation of a spinning
"prize wheel" image (+sound) to select a name from a list, based upon
[jQuery Roulette Wheel](https://github.com/JavoByte/rouletteWheel).
This can be used to randomly select students in a classroom to answer
questions (with or without replacement of names).

You can immediately use it at [metamodel.blog/page/wheel](https://metamodel.blog/page/wheel/)
without having to install any code. 

See the [help file](http://code.mitotic.org/wheel/help.html)
for more detailed usage info.

## Implementation

This project simply adds a landing page (``www/index.html``) with Javascript
and an audio file (``www/prize_wheel.mp3``) to
[jQuery Roulette Wheel](https://github.com/JavoByte/rouletteWheel) to
implement the web site.
